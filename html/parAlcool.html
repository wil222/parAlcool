		<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
		<p>HUMAN is a collection of stories about and images of our world, offering an immersion to the core of what it means to be human. Through these stories full of love and happiness, as well as hatred and violence, HUMAN brings us face to face with the Other, making us reflect on our lives. From stories of everyday experiences to accounts of the most unbelievable lives, these poignant encounters share a rare sincerity and underline who we are – our darker side, but also what is most noble in us, and what is universal. Our Earth is shown at its most sublime through never-before-seen aerial images accompanied by soaring music, resulting in an ode to the beauty of the world, providing a moment to draw breath and for introspection.<br><br> HUMAN is a politically engaged work which allows us to embrace the human condition and to reflect on the meaning of our existence.</p>

		<h2>THE DIRECTOR</h2>
		<p>Yann Arthus-Bertrand is a photographer and renowned specialist in aerial imagery. He has written several books, including “The Earth from the Air”, which has been translated into 24 languages and has sold more than three million copies.</p><p>In 2009, he made his first film, “Home”. This inventory of the planet was seen by more than 600 million people around the world. Available for free from YouTube, it is continuing its career. It is the most successful environmental film of the decade.</p><p>“7 Billion Others”, a portrait of humanity today, has so far been seen by 350 million people. This major exhibition that was inaugurated at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2009, before going on to travel the world, is a personal reflection developed over the space of 30 years.</p><p>It was the first step on the path that led Yann Arthus-Bertrand to make “HUMAN”.</p>

For five years, he hosted the famous show “Vu du Ciel” which explored environmental issues for the public broadcaster, francetélévisions.</p><p>In 2011, he made the film Planet Ocean with Michaël Pitiot, in which his incredible aerial photography accompanied by gripping footage from award-winning marine photographers took audiences on a unique journey into the very heart of our blue planet.</p><p>Since 2005 and the creation of the GoodPlanet Foundation, Yann Arthus-Bertrand has been committed to educating about the environment and the fight against climate change and its consequences. This commitment led to him being named a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Program on 22 April 2009.</p>

			<h1>A COLLABORATIVE, INDEPENDENT AND POLITICALLY ENGAGED PROJECT</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>A WORK SUPPORTED BY THE BETTENCOURT SCHUELLER FOUNDATION</h2>
		<div class="row-table">
			<p class="lead col-md-8">Human is the result of a unique collaboration and production. For the first time, two non-profit organizations have come together to enable an exceptional project to come into being.<br><br> The Bettencourt Schueller Foundation fully financed the production of this cinematographic work for philanthropic reasons, with the aim of giving it rights-free to the GoodPlanet Foundation, which drove the project, and which, with the participation France Télévisions, sets out to distribute HUMAN in the freest conditions to the widest possible audience.<br><br> This exceptional partnership allowed Yann Arthus-Bertrand to create a highly original work, and to release it in the most accessible conditions and to the widest possible audience.</p>

				<p>For almost 30 years, the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation has been using film to serve the projects it supports, in the life sciences, the arts, and social actions. By supporting Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s HUMAN project, the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation is continuing its commitment to “valuable images”. These are images that inspire us to share a collective approach to renewing our relationship with our environment – either natural or manmade. They have been created by major directors whose personal vocations fit with a desire to celebrate the beauty of the living world, to raise awareness of the fragility of our environment, and to promote a humanistic vision of our future.</p><p>This commitment follows in the same vein as the other cinematographic works supported by the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, including <em>Le Syndrome du Titanic</em> by Nicolas Hulot and Jean-Albert Lièvre, <em>Winged Migration</em>, <em>Océans</em> and <em>Les Saisons</em> by Jacques Perrin, and <em>La Glace et le Ciel</em> by Luc Jacquet.</p><p>Without the support of the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, HUMAN would never have been made and would not have benefited from this international, multi-support roll-out, which was itself a key condition for the Foundation’s backing of such a project.</p>
